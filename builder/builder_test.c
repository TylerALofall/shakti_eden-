/* builder_test.c — the harness for mommas_little_builder.c
 *
 * A fixed 12-command curriculum, 400 beats, then the pins of record.
 * Deterministic: the teacher supplies every epoch; the organ reads no
 * clock. -O0 must equal -O2, byte for byte.
 *
 * The curriculum walks every law:
 *   TEMPO dial, HB toggle (slot 2), SPEAK, LEARN with tags,
 *   a LOOK with a red button and a blue button (she must see both),
 *   USE before training (refused: not taught), TRAIN (the brand lands),
 *   USE after training (the actuator runs), and one honest UNKNOWN.
